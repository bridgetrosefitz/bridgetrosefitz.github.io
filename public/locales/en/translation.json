It is the best tool I know to build things that help people; it forces us to be scientific and truthful; it has a massive community building ways to share knowledge efficiently; and it locks you into a process of learning and improving forever. These are things I care about deeply.\n\nI’m an Aussie, but have lived and worked in NYC, Paris and Oslo. I speak French, Japanese and some Chinese. People know me as someone who loves languages, culture, people and ideas - I think it’s awesome to bake those things into tech.\n\nI’m a grammar and vocab nerd, but ultimately I just love expressing things simply, so everyone can understand and share gems of insight, without ego or pretense.\n\n Voilà. I hope we get to meet one day! Say hello, if you’d like.",

From my experience, the RACI (or DACI) framework provides a helpful level of detail to make clear who is responsible for getting a job done well. It reduces the risk of low quality work arising from murky or pooled accountability, it helps make sure the right people have input on tasks (and conversely, gives team members explicit authority to make decisions without input!), and it prompts conversations about workload and capacity.\n\nOn past projects, I used Google Sheets to build my own RACI frameworks. This app has the advantage of being a standardized process which is simple to use, and of supporting functionality such as flags and alerts, issue-tracking and workflow tools."

It also gives visibility on where representation is low, allowing organizers to seek more balanced participation."
