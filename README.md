## Why I made it

This website was a labor of ♡. I implemented 3D meshes and physics, rolled my own CSS, wrote and applied translations, and enjoyed developing the design. I hope you feel like you know me a little better by taking a look around. In any case, welcome. Please do drop me a line with feedback! 

## How it's made

### Technology

* React.js
* Three.js, to create the sphere (implemented with React Three Fiber) 
* Cannon, to apply physics to the scene
* i18next, for translations
* AOS, for the scroll animations

### User Stories

I kept myself organized with my user stories, available [here](https://bridgetrosefitz.notion.site/Bridget-Fitzgerald-Personal-website-57cf2e253112453884670a3cb9b44ecc).
